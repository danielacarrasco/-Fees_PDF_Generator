Overview
========

This is a python and VBA based code that generates a PDF with the study fees.
This was made an executable ``FeesTemplate_main.exe``

Requirements
========

HESA files provided by the Academic Applications Management team, which includes 5 Excel tables of the following type:

- FILE_AU_AND_INT_CO_DATA_TABLE

- FILE_AU_FEES_DATA_TABLE

- FILE_CAP_ASSES_FEES_DATA_TABLE

- FILE_CSP_FEES_DATA_TABLE

- FILE_INT_FEES_DATA_TABLE

Usage
=====

1. Go to the Publising Requirements folder ``A:\\Planning and Performance\Student Compliance and Reporting\Publishing Requirements>`` (restricted access).
2. Go to the current year's folder and create a new folder with the format *yyyy_yyyymmdd* (Example: "*2018_20180215*" for HESA files corresponding to 15-Feb-18).
3. Copy the HESA files provided by the Fees team into the folder from point 2.
4. Run the executable FeesTemplate_main.exe and 6 files will be generated in the folder that has been recenlty created. Those are the files that need to be uploaded to the website. 

Troubleshooting
=====

* The most common problem occurs when opening the running the program for the first time. You have to enable content and trust the files in order for the executable to work. If this is the case, authorise them and run the program again.
* Make sure the folder from the previous date contains the right files.
* Check that the new HESA files are in the current date's folder.

Warnings
=======

* While the command window is open, do not do anything
* The actual program is inside the folder Fees Program. Do not modify anything in there.
